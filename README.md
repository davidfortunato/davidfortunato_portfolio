# Power BI Project: Sales Analysis of Marsal Co.

## Project Background and Overview

Marsal Co. (fictional company) is a US based versatile retail chain that sells a wide variety of products via website and mobile app. The company produces large amounts of data, regarding sales, that have been severely underutilized and can be leveraged by multiple teams inside the company, including Marketing, Sales and Operations to bring more revenue and better allocate company's resources.

## Insights Deep Dive

### Sales Trends

- Marsal's sales experienced a local peak in December 2019, 522 orders, followed by a significant decline during the early months of COVID-19. After March 2020, sales began to recover steadily, reaching a new peak in December 2020, 637 orders. This trend aligns with the global drop in consumption at the onset of the pandemic, followed by continuous growth as the initial impact of COVID subsided.
- In both years, the months surrounding the holiday season (November and December) show a clear increase in order volume, with growth of 91.32% and 2.96% in 2019, and 53.07% and 2.25% in 2020. This aligns with expected seasonal fluctuations. However, during the same period in 2019, there was a significant decline in profit, dropping by -123.23% in November and -473.72% in December.
- The average sales value showed steady growth leading up to COVID, peaking at $502.28 in February 2020. Afterward, it declined and did not fully recover by the end of 2020.
- The most profitable season was summer, with July, August, and September seeing profit increases of 40.18% in 2019 and 14.16% in 2020. This can largely be attributed to strong performance in the Accessories category, which saw significant growth during this quarter, with 160.45% in 2019 and 57.42% in 2020.

### Location Analysis

- Two key states contribute a significant portion of Marsal's profit: California, with $50,125, and New York, with $43,504, together accounting for 38% of the total profit. This aligns with the fact that both California and New York are among the wealthiest and most populous states in the U.S.A..
